    Much probably my most cherished pet project.
    It is far from being the best code I have written
    but for sure is the one I had the most fun with.

    As a developer who lacks the formal education
    I am on a self inflicted mission to acquire
    the Computer Science knowledge that I don't have yet.
    This project was part a little stone
    that I managed to lay down on this path.
