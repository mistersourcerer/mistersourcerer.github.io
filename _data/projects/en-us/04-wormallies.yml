  This one made me smile a lot.
  it was way bigger in scope when I conceived it
  then in it's current form though.
  I wanted to synchronize the appearance of food
  and posiong particles with "good" and "bad" interactions
  of the player on Social Medias.
  So the game itself would be "just" the front end for this idea.
  I might revisit it and try to go full bananas on this project.
  But for now it makes for a very familiar gaming experience :).

  I really needed to get my knives sharper
  on the web front end arena at the time.
  There was just too much stuff that I wasn't aware of.
  My days of hiding deep inside the backend development cave needed a break.
  I really enjoy f.e. stuff, though.
  So I carved some free time to play around with it.
