  This has way better code and documentation and polishing
  than one can find in Ruspea, that is for sure XD.
  This was a project I wrote to get back in the swing
  after coming back from a short sabbatical I gave myself
  when moving back to Brazil.

  It makes very clear that I am still
  in the mood to keep studying language implementation, design
  and all the things in between.
  I can say that this is the type of software I am comfortable
  writing on my free time.
