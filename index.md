# Hi, my name is Ricardo Valeriano

And I go as @mistersourcerer on the interwebz.

You are here probably interested in
my software development related skills and activities.
Some paragraphs below you will find a compilation of such things.
But before we go about it,
I would like to first tell you that
in this arena I see myself more
as a **problem solver**{:.text-highlight}
than anything else.

## A kind of a portfolio

It is my pleasure to introduce you to
some of my **pet projects**{:.text-highlight}, experiences
and general software development related stuff
(in no particular order)
**that you might enjoy**{:.text-highlight}.
This is a short list,
if you want a more comprehensive one
I can strongly suggest that you find me on the socialz:

<br />
Right after this brief list of projects there is some more writing
to let you know what are my feelings and relationship
with software development and the industry nowadays.

I really do hope you enjoy the tour.

## A lifetime of software development

Swimming on those waters for more than 20 years
I developed a strong sense
that **0 lines of code means 0 chances of bugs**{:.text-highlight}.
This feeling was honed while I tried
different angles in this same field
**by programming, some years teaching
and finally leading tech teams**{:.text-highlight}.

I first got **passionated about software development**{:.text-highlight}
because it can actually **transform reallity**{:.text-highlight}.

But for the occasions when I am
really convinced that a software based solution
will be **the thing that saves time, money**{:.text-highlight}
and maybe even **ensure a better mental health**{:.text-highlight}
for all people involved in solving a given issue,
then it is indeed a blast
to pull my software development paraphernalia
and jump right into it.

One of the most **gratifying**{:.text-highlight}
aspects of delivering software
is to see **the creativity flow running from
the users that now can be free to exercise it**{:.text-highlight}.

You can find me on the following social networks:
