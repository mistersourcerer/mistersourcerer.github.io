# Hi, my name is Ricardo Valeriano

And I go as @mistersourcerer on the interwebz.

You are here probably interested in
my software development related skills and activities.
Some paragraphs below you will find a compilation of such things.
But before we go about it,
I would like to first tell you that
in this arena I see myself more
as a **problem solver**{:.text-highlight}
than anything else.

Swimming on those waters for more than 20 years
I developed a strong sense
that **0 lines of code means 0 chances of bugs**{:.text-highlight}.
This feeling was honed while I tried
different angles in this same field,
**sometimes programming, others teaching
and finally leading tech teams**{:.text-highlight}.

I got passionated about software development
because it can actually transform reallity.

For those occasions,
**when I am really convinced that a software based solution
will be the thing that saves time,
money**{:.text-highlight}
and maybe even ensures a better mental health
for all people involved in solving a given issue,
then **it is indeed a blast
to pull my software development paraphernalia
and jump right into it**{:.text-highlight}.

One of the most **gratifying**{:.text-highlight}
aspects of delivering software
is to see **the creativity flow running from
the users that now can be free to exercise it**{:.text-highlight}.

You can find me on the following social networks:


## A kind of a portfolio

And finally I would like to show you
some of my pet-projects, experiences
and general software development related stuff
that I have authored and you might enjoy:
