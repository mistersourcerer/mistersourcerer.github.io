# Ol√°, eu sou o Ricardo Valeriano

And I go as @mistersourcerer on the interwebz.
When developing software I like to focus on
problems that need to be solved and why
instead of the how or even "with what".

Probably the more than 20 years on the field
gave me the clarity that 0 lines of code
means 0 chances of bugs.
So no software is te preferred metric,
and then, starting from this baseline,
I try to build up solutions that are
the simplest that can solve the problem the best.
